Welcome,

Step Into is a place to unravel the inner workings of some technological stuffs
I find interesting. It is derived from the "step into" debugger functionality
that let us, well, step into a function call.

The aim is to provide the simplest explainations to the most interesting things
out there while trying to follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle.

Even though I have a list of things that I'd like to step into, requests are
always welcome.

In order to keep things simple, the format is a simple ascii for the posts.
There might be some additional files attached and different formats depending
on the requirements that will follow.

This site resides in <a href=https://github.com/sagidana/sagidana.github.io>github</a> and requests are welcome via pull requests/issues.

Each post will be under the <a href="posts.html">posts</a> folder.
